  Loved this post! It is so easy to get wrapped up in the every day hustle, not
  noticing how our cortisol and stress responses are triggered by what's around
  us. I appreciate the way you explain how mindful breathing and movement can
  help combat these responses & allow our bodies to enter a state of relaxation.
  Definitely need to start practicing this more.

message: "For a while I was searching to reconnect my inner body flow and I was constantly going to different yoga classes without achieving the feeling any form of improvement.\r\nIt was only when I worked with yogigyle I understood the importance  of perfecting each pose I do in yoga and engaging it with full precision and concentration. Only know am I seeing the results Iâ€™ve been yearning for, and in the process I learned to appreciate and  fell in love with yoga on a different level."

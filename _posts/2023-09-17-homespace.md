<h3>Find a Spot That Makes You Feel Peaceful</h3>
<p>
For me, this means somewhere with natural lighting that’s ideally free of noise and distractions. Never underestimate the power of lighting! A space with natural light will naturally energize the body and mind, especially during colder months when many people have minimal exposure to sunlight.

<h3>Consider Where to Place Your Mat</h3>
<p>
If you have the space, I’d highly recommend leaving your mat out so it’s ready and waiting for you anytime – one less thing to do. If the weather allows it, practicing outdoors (in a backyard, or on a patio or roof) in the fresh air always makes me feel extra zen. You can switch it up – feel it out and see what makes you feel most energized.

<h3>All You Need Is Your Mat & Creativity</h3>

<h3>Keep It Clean</h3>
<p>
I am a true believer that physical clutter leads to mental clutter. If your yoga space is clean and organized, you’ll be that much more drawn to spend time there. Put away anything unnecessary, and if you do have a few yoga props, try placing them in a designated space when you’re done using them.

<h3>Lastly - Make It Your Own!</h3>

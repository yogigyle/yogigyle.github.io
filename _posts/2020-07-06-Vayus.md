<p>Yogic theory states that there are 5 layers that make up the human existence (Pancha Kosha). These are the physical body, <b>energy body</b>, mental body, intellectual body, and blissful body.<br />
<br />
I’m going to focus here on the Energy body (Pranayama Kosha), the 2nd layer of human existence. We can understand the concept of Prana as <b>life force energy</b> that travels thorugh the body by way of a network of channels called “Nadis.” Chakras, which are energy centers located at different points in the body, control the circulation of Prana, and I’ll explore the concept of Chakras much more deeply in a later post.<br />
<br />
Yoga is a dance of your body & breath. When ancient yogis figured out that they could strengthen & steady the mind by simply controlling their flow of breath, they also realized that they could categorize Prana into five different vayus, meansing “air” or “wind.” The 5 vayus describe 5 different patterns of movement of prana throughout the body, and their distinct effects on the body & mind.</p>

<h2>Prana</h2>
Regulates upward flows of energy such as intake and inhalation, drinking, and swallowing. This relates to all of the stimuli that our five senses intake, which is in one word, PLENTY. Balancing excessive stimulation in a heathy way can mean the ability to recognize when one needs silence, space, and time alone to focus inward. Basically, this is what yoga is all about for me. Recognizing that what you need is time with yourself, and actually taking the steps to make that happen. 10/10 recommend.</p>

<h2>Apana</h2>
Regulates downwards flows of energy such as exhalation, releasing toxins, birthing, and elimination. Mentally, this can mean knowing and recognizing when it’s in our best interest to let go of certain thoughts, memories, and even unhealthy situations and relationships in our lives that are no longer contributing any positivity or meaning.</p>

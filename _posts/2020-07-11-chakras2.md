    In my previous post, I covered the first three chakras which govern survival instincts, pleasure, and willpower. This post will explore the following four chakras, which are more spiritual in nature and govern love, self-expression, intuition, and higher consciousness.

    <h2>Anahata</h2>
    <span class="image right"><img src="{% link assets/images/chakras_anahata.jpg %}" alt="" /></span>
    <p>
    <b>Anahata, the Heart Chakra, represents the integration between the 3 lower “physical” chakras with the 3 higher, more spiritual chakras</b> (representing the higher & lower aspects of man’s nature).
    <p>
    Anahata is the center for <b>universal love for ourselves and others, compassion, kindness, and acceptance.</b>  As this chakra is activated, feelings of universal tolerance develop and we become able to accept and love others <i>for what they are</i>, not for what we wish they were. 
    <p>
    When balanced: We become able to experience compassion & selfless love. The ability to feel <b>compassion, meaning that your experience with people is based more on harmony & relatedness than conflict & separation,</b> marks a major step forward towards higher consciousness from the lower chakras. <b>When your heart chakra is aligned, you experience an abundance of compassion, love, and general good vibes – both in terms of putting it out into the universe and receiving it back.</b>
    <p>
    When overactive: We can lose a sense a personal boundary <b>“in the name of love”</b> and start to prioritize other’s needs over our own. I fully believe that nothing is more valuable in this world than love, but in an unhealthy situation it can also become an excuse for accepting things that aren’t in your own self-interest, This is why it’s crucial to stay self-aware and remember to check in with yourself about how you feel in your relationships (romantic, friends, and family).
    <p>
    When underactive: We tend to feel closed-off, defensive, fearful of betrayal, and “put walls up.” Hatred towards yourself and others also signals to a closed off heart charka - especially in the form of holding grudges. What’s important to consider is that harboring negative feelings only cuts you off from giving love to the universe and receiving it in return. <b>Ultimately, working towards the ability to trust others again is emotional empowerment and this is what balancing the heart chakra is all about.</b>
    <p>
    To balance: Treat yourself exactly how you want to be treated and only give energy to relationships where you are treated this way. Spread compassion, respect, and love. Practice self-care. Make sure that you’re open to receiving love but that most importantly you’re receiving it from yourself.
    <p>
    <b>Activating Poses:</b> <br/>
    Poses that open the chest and shoulders such as Camel, Backbends, Reverse Plank, and Upward-Facing Dog all energize the heart chakra.

    <h2>Vishuddhi</h2>
    <span class="image left"><img src="{% link assets/images/chakras_vishuddhi.jpg %}" alt="" /></span>
    <p>
    Vishuddhi, the first of the three spiritual chakras, is located at the throat center where nurturance (food and air) is taken into the body. Also called the Throat Chakra, <b>provides energy for speaking and expressing ourselves clealrly and creatively. Creativity can bring into awareness something previously unknown, and when energy is focused on this center, one becomes able to receive from an inner, unlimited source. This is when consciousness begins to move to the next chakra, and the concept that “higher consciousness is within” begins to make sense.</b>
    <p>
    When balanced: We are able to speak with clarity and express our truths, able to “read” situations, and feel in tune with our own intentions. 
    <p>
    When overactive: An overactive throat chakra manifests in behaviors such as raising one’s voice & interrupting as a result of feeling ignored/ invalidated, as well as “loving to hear oneself speak.” 
    <p>
    <b>Ever heard the phrase “You’ll feel much better once you talk about it”</b> or that “bottling up your feelings is bad for you?” A <b>blocked</b> throat chakra can lead to feelings of neediness, difficulty making decisions, and a general lack of confidence to ask for what you need. <b>Aside from difficulty expressing yourself and constant fear of judgement from others, this type of imbalance can physically manifest as thyroid issues, throat pain, neck & shoulder stiffness, and tension headaches as the energy is sent back down to lower charkas</b> (the connection between emotional imbalances & disease is a whole other subject, which I’ll explore in a later post).
    <p>
    To Energize: Practice expressing emotions even when alone (it’s a start!). <b>Receive your own truth!</b> This will slowly help build the confidence needed to speak your mind and express yourself in more intimidating circumstances. 
    <p>
    <b>Activating Poses:</b> <br/>
    Poses that energize and balance the throat chakra focus on the neck and throat area, including: neck stretches, Cat/cow, Plow, Shoulder-stand, & Fish pose.

    <h2>Ajna</h2>
    <span class="image right"><img src="{% link assets/images/chakras_ajna.jpg %}" alt="" /></span>
    <p>
    Ajna, the “Third Eye,” is physically located in between the eyebrows and regulates certain parts of the brain (influencing stress response,) the eyes, and the pituitary gland (which plays a major role in regulating vital body functions.) Ajna’s element is the <b>mind</b>; the center of wisdom, intuition, imagination, and visualization. When energy is focused here, we become able to think with clarity & trust our own intuition. <b>Intuition is the sense of being drawn to something that’s in our best interest despite our conscious mind’s hesitation. Everyone has it, focusing inward through yoga and meditation will help develop the courage to trust it.</b>
    <p>
    <b>The Third Eye is the bridge between you and the outside world, and focusing energy on it allows you to cut through the drama and mirages and see things for what they are.</b>
    <p>
    When balanced: We feel insightful, self-aware, and equally in tune with ourselves and our surroundings. We become able to “see with our third eye” which means considering everything as an <b>observer</b> rather than an <b>experiencer.</b>
    <p>
    When blocked: We feel out of touch with reality and disconnected from ourselves, have difficulty trusting our own intuition, and therefore have difficulty making decisions and “seeing the bigger picture.” 
    <p>
    To energize: Practice focusing on and trusting your own intuition, devote time to quiet solitary meditation and limit exposure to situations that make you feel depleted. Try to consider honestly what is currently making you happy and what isn’t.
    <p>
    <b>Activating Poses:</b> <br/>
    Wide-Legged Forward Fold, an accessible inverted position, provides an instant shift in perception. Letting your forehead come into contact with the floor (or a block) and staying in the position for 1-2 minutes stimulates the Third Eye Chakra and helps build confidence to trust your own instincts. Childs pose, an even more accessible position, provides then same benefits.

    <h2>Saharsara</h2>
    <span class="image left"><img src="{% link assets/images/chakras_saharsara.jpg %}" alt="" /></span>
    <p>
    Saharsara, “The Crown Chakra,” represents our spiritual being. This is the point where individual consciousness merges with higher consciousness, universal knowledge and truth enter the body, and we become able to move past the physical and connect to what’s beyond the tangible experience. Essentially this is considered the “final goal” of yoga.
    <p>
    Saharsara is located at the crown of the head, its element is <b>thought</b> and it correlates to the pineal gland. 
    <p>
    When balanced: We connect our “higher selves” and achieve liberation from suffering & death. <b>The journey of attempting to balance Saharsara will naturally balance the other chakras, and is called BEING HUMAN.</b>
    <p>
    To balance: Since balancing the first 6 chakras are part of the journey to a balanced Saharsara, the best way to begin is by learning about each chakra and what is represents. <b>Choose one or two that you identify with, and explore. Use the information to energize, strengthen, balance, and learn more about yourself.</b>
    <p>
    <b>Activating Poses:</b> <br/>
    <b>Sirsasana</b> (Headstand) and <b>Vriksasana</b> (Tree Pose) both initiate the flow of energy from the root of your body to the top of your head, aligning the chakras and calming the mind (as well as improving balance, posture, and alertness).
    <hr />

<div>
    <h2>Bottom Line - It's Not All or Nothing</h2>
    <p>
    Yes, the chakras work as a system to interact and influence one another. But even by starting with a focus on one center of energy within yourself, you can begin to understand if there’s something in your life causing an imbalance.

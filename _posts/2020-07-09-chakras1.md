    Odds are, if you’ve ever taken a yoga class or listened to a guided meditation, you’ve heard the instructor mention “opening up” the chakras. But what are they, really? “Chakra” translates from Sanskrit to “wheel” or “disk,” and refers to an internal energy system. The chakra system originated in India between 1500 and 500 BC in a text called the <b>Vedas</b>, which are the earliest Sanskrit records and the most ancient scriptures of Hinduism. The 7 chakras control circulation of Prana (life force energy) in the body, and are located along a pathway of <i>Sushumna</i>, an energy channel which flows up the spinal cord to the top of the head.
    <p>
    <b>When the chakras are activated and aligned, we feel most connected to ourselves and to the world. </b> Basically, all aspects of our lives seem to flow naturally and fluidly. Concentration on chakras, <b>through different yoga postures</b> (as well as breathing exercises & meditation techniques) stimulates the flow of energy and allows us to empower our mind, body, and soul.
    <p>
    Each chakra has its own special defining features and corresponds to different emotional, physical, mental, and spiritual aspects of life. <b>When psychological issues related to a chakra have not been resolved, the imbalance can cause physical and emotional issues.</b>

    <h2>Muladhara</h2>
    <p>
    Muladhara, located at the root of the spine, is the <b>Root Chakra</b>, the source of all <i>spiritual, sexual, emotional, mental, and psychic</i> energy. <b>Moodlahara corresponds to the Earth element, and is responsible for our sense of grounding, security, and survival- the feeling that our basic needs (such as water, food and shelter) are being met, as well as our basic emotional needs to feel a sense of safety.</b>
    <p>
    When balanced: We feel a sense of accomplishment and peace regarding money, safety, shelter, and feeling connected to human experience.
    <p>
    When overactive: We experience anxiety based on survival instincts (this can manifest as digestive & lower back issues and other pains), lack of a sense of belonging, and feelings of insecurity and fear. A blocked root chakra can also cause anxiety disorders and nightmares, expressing our repressed unconscious fears.
    <p>
    To balance: Focus on nurturing your soul, listen to your body, incorporate grounding and leg-strengthening postures into your yoga practice. Do what you need to do in order to feel more grounded and in touch with yourself. In my experience the fool-proof way to do this is through connecting with nature - this can be as simple as taking a walk and letting whatever thoughts come up flow through your mind.
    <p>
    <b>Activating Poses:</b> <br/>
    Grounding postures such as Tree, Mountain, Warrior B, & Wide-Legged Seated Forward Bend (Upavistha Konasana).

    <h2>Swadhisthana, <i>“One’s Own Dwelling Place”</i></h2>
    <p>
    Swadhisthana, the <b>Sacral Chakra</b>, is the center of sexual desires and cravings, located in the pelvic area. It controls creative and sexual energy in the body - as well as our ability to be in tune with ourselves and others. 
    <p>
    <b>Swadhisthana determines how we define a healthy relationship, how we choose those relationships with others, what those relationships mean to us and how we behave within them, and what gives us motivation.</b>
    <p>
    When balanced: We feel passionate and fulfilled by life, and are able to enjoy life’s pleasures, establish healthy boundaries, and adapt to change when necessary. 
    <p>
    When imbalanced: an <b>overactive</b> Swasthihana chakra can manifest in addiction and being controlled by impulsive behaviors, as well as insensitivity to boundaries and excessive emotional dependence. On the other hand, an <b>underactive</b> Swasthihana chakra can be indicated by an over-focus on practicality, a lack of passion & creativity, emotional hypersensitivity, trust issues, fear of pleasure and/or low sex drive.
    <p>
    To energize: Simply enjoy life and the all the gifts that this planet offers us. <b>Do what makes you feel inspired, energized, and grounded while keeping in mind that these things are only pleasurable because you are choosing to do them.</b> Experiment with activities that inspire creative expression.
    <p>
    <b>Activating Poses:</b> <br/>
    Hip-opening poses that allow negative emotions to flow out of your body as you relax deeper into the stretch such as: Goddess, Pigeon, Straddle, Revolved Triangle pose, Frog pose, and Happy Baby.

    <h2>Manipura, <i>“City of Jewels”</i></h2>
    <p>
    Manipura, the Solar Plexus Chakra, controls feelings of <b>self-confidence, personal power, and identity.</b> When balanced and activated, Manipura is also called the “Warrior Chakra” and is symbolized by the <b>fire</b> element - an inner flame providing the energy for everything we do.
    <p>
    <b>This chakra influences how we react to situations that life throws at us; how much control we try to exert over our surroundings, as well as whether we judge others as inferior or superior and how we then behave accordingly. </b>
    <p>
    When balanced: We feel capable and empowered without feeling the need to assert that power forcefully, are able to make healthy decisions, have a consistent energy levels, and experience healthy digestion.
    <p>
    When overactive: An overactive Manipura chakra can manifest in behaviors such as an <b>obsession with control & power over others, micromanaging, excessive competitiveness and lack of empathy.</b> I also think it’s extremely important to mention here that an <b>overactive Manipura can also lead to feeling overly competitive with yourself. Learning about the chakras opened my eyes to the fact that while I rarely feel competitive with others, I felt as though I was in an almost constant state of competition with myself, and that feeling was taking up so much energy that could be used in significantly more constructive ways.</b> I’m constantly reminding myself that life isn’t a race against myself, progress doesn’t <i>have</i> to be daily, and half the fun of learning/ improving at something is taking the time to stop, CHILL, and process what’s going on. Realizing this has made me sensitive to make an effort to simply give myself a chance to be proud of myself (and it’s still a work in progress).
    <p>
    When underactive: An underactive Manipura chakra can manifest in feelings of insecurity, shyness, inability to make decisions, and a feeling of feeling being “overly-needy.” In contrast to how overactivity leads to a constant need to assert dominance, <b>overly-submissive behavior and an inability to stand up for oneself can indicate an underactive Manipura.</b>
    <p>
    To balance: Think of everything you’re good at, make a list! Even if it feels crazy! Create personal affirmations, remind yourself that it’s okay to be your own critic, <i>as long as you’re also your own biggest supporter.</i> 
    <p>
    <b>Activating Poses:</b> <br/>
    Maipura is located near the ribcage and governs all digestive and stomach-related processes, so poses that fire up the core such as Boat pose, Plank, Warrior C, Plow pose, Shoulder Stand, & Bow pose are great for balancing energies, regulating digestion, and providing an instant boost in mood and confidence.

    <h2>The Chakras, Continued</h2>
    <p>
    The first 3 chakras largely control how we identify physically and emotionally, and how we relate to the external world. It’s important to understand that focusing on and balancing our lower chakras is a major component of connecting to our physical, mental and spiritual well-being .

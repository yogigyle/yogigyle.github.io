<p>I’m Avigyle, raised in NYC and living in Tel Aviv since 2017.</p>

<p>My love affair with yoga began while I was in University 4 years ago, and has since increasingly grown stronger, reinforced by my realization and experience of the countless beneficial effects of a consistent practice.</p>

<p>As my relationship with yoga evolves, I find myself feeling stronger in mind, body, and spirit, all working together in harmony; a refreshing release from the external unpredictability and volatility of what one typically experiences in life. I am humbled to have studied and received my RYT Certification at Yoga Vidya Mandiram in Rishikesh, India, an experience which opened my eyes to the beautiful ideas and varied philosophies behind the physical practice itself.</p>

<p>I currently teach private & small group lessons with sequences that I mold to each individual’s specific goals, allowing everyone to recognize their unique potential. Witnessing this growth and the positive impact it has on my students is one of the most rewarding feelings I experience, and why I continue to embrace opportunities to teach.</p>
